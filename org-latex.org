#+TITLE: Writing LaTeX in org

Tell emacs where to find your library/bibliography in the emacs config.
~(setq org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/src/papers/library.bib"))~

Adding and sorting citations

~C-c ]~ opens an interface to select and insert citations.
Pick a citation using ~Enter~ or use ~C-SPC~ to pick multiple citations then
press ~Enter~ to insert them. In case you feel the citations need to have some
order, sort them by publication date using ~org-ref-sort-citation-link~ or
~S-up~ (S is shift).

To generate the pdf switch to main.org and run M-x org-latex-export-to-latex
then from the terminal run make.
